			<p align="justify"> The Cavendish Inspiring Women Group put out a call for people to pitch a game changing idea that would help to 
			reduce the gender gap in STEM subjects. I saw this and thought it was a great idea! So I couldn't resist and submitted 
			an entry. To my delight, they liked my pitch and have invited me to visit Cambridge to tell them more about my idea. The date of the event 
			has been postponed to May/June. I will update this page accordingly. </p>
			
			
			<p align="justify"> Here is my pitch:</p>
			<h3>Over the last couple of decades, there has been a drive to engage the public with research, break down stereotypes and 
			increase diversity within STEM subjects. Although there has been an increase in women studying STEM subjects, the number of 
			permanent academic female staff has not changed.</h3> 

			<h3>I believe this discrepancy arises due to the current academic career path. The nature of post-doctoral research requires a 
			person to relocate every couple of years and does not provide any job security. These instabilities come at a critical time 
			in a person's life. Due to this, an early career researcher may feel they have to choose between their career and family life.</h3>

			<h3>In order for this trend to change, the academic career path needs to change. I believe that the STEM funding bodies have the 
			power to do this. By partnering with universities and research institutions, schemes could be created to appease these obstacles. 
			I propose that funding bodies could employ postdoctoral researchers directly for periods greater than a typical placement. The 
			funding body would then place the researcher in research institutions. These placements would be localised, for example within a 
			few countries or a continent. Schemes like this would provide early career researchers with more stability, job security and 
			employee benefits.</h3>

			<h3>Increasing the number of women in academia will help to narrow the gender gap from the top down, by creating more female role 
			models to inspire future generations.</h3>
