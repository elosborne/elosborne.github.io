			<p align="justify">Every year the Royal Society hosts their Summer Science Exhibition. The event runs for a week at the beginning of July, is free to attend and open to everyone.
			 The exhibition is your opportunity to talk to scientists and researchers to find out about the exciting science that is happening across the U.K.</p>

			 <p>I was involved in the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/listen2theuniverse">'Listen to the Universe'</a> exhibit. This was a collaboration between the U.K. and German gravitational wave research institutions.
			  As a part of this, I collaborated with <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/maths/about/staff/nils.page">Prof. Nils Andersson</a> and artist
			 <a href="http://olidean.com/">Ollie Dean</a> to produce an illustrated leaflet on gravitational waves aimed at a non-specialist audience. I also received science communication training from the <a href="http://sciencemuseum.org.uk/">Science Museum</a>.</p>
			
			
										
									
			
			<p align="justify">Being at the Royal Society for the week was great fun! I thoroughly enjoyed speaking about gravitational waves and my research to such a broad audience. 
			One of my favourite aspects was hearing everyone's incredibly thought provoking questions. It's fascinating to see how people think and the ideas they come up with. Sometimes the
			questions are so inspiring I use them in my research and other times they are so challenging I can't provide answer.  A truly amazing experience I hope to have the privilege of doing again!</p>
