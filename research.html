			<p align="justify">On 14th September 2015, gravitational waves were directly observed for the first time. The discovery by the LIGO collaboration came 100 years 
			after Einstein's prediction in his General Theory of Relativity. Gravitational waves enable the universe to be seen in a new way, by providing information that 
			goes beyond the traditional tools of electromagnetic radiation. </p>
 
 
			<p align="justify"> My research examines how neutron stars, a type of dead star, emit gravitational waves by growing mountains. These neutron stars are incredibly 
			dense and for a spinning neutron star to emit gravitational waves, it must first distort from its spherical shape. As the deformed neutron star spins, it creates ripples in 
			space and time. A neutron star can generate a gravitational wave signal that is detectable on earth by growing mountains only a few millimetres high.</p>
			
			<p align="justify">One mechanism that enables mountain growth is the presence of hot spots in  the neutron star's crust. Hot spots can arise through a process called accretion. 
			Accretion occurs when the neutron star's gravitational field draws material from a neighbouring star onto its surface.  This accreted material is compressed as 
			more accreted material falls on top of it. This compression causes the matter to increase in density. As the density increases, nuclear reactions begin to occur. 
			These reactions generate heat. If the accreted matter falls onto the star unevenly, then hot spots can arise from the heat generated by the nuclear reactions.</p>

			<p align="justify">The key questions I am trying to answer are: Can hot spots develop in this way? If so, then how long do they live for? Are they hot enough and do they live long 
			enough to generate mountains large enough to produce gravitational wave signals that can be detected here on earth? </p>
			
			<p align="justify"> Researching the dynamical behaviour of neutron stars provides information on how the laws of physics behave in extreme gravity environments, something that 
			cannot be replicated on earth. Gravitational wave astronomy opens a new window to the universe by illuminating dark matter and many other aspects of our universe 
			waiting to be discovered. </p>
