			<p align="justify"> This year I finally mustered up the courage and applied to take part in FameLab. FameLab is an international science communication competition.
			In this competition, each competitor has just three minutes to convey a scientific topic of their choice and they will be judged on clarity, charisma and content. 
			I decided to take a little bit of a risk and delivered my whirlwind talk on time travel. The risk paid off, and to my delight, I made it through the heats to the London 
			regional finals. For the finals, I had to create a completely new set, this time I chose intergalactic communication using gravitational waves.</p>
			
			<p align="justify">My topics of choice may sound like science fiction, but the contents were 100% science fact, with a little bit of imagination on the possibilities of where 
			science might one day lead. When I communicate science, I try to leave the audience member wanting to know more and thinking about all of the possibilities, as this is where my 
			passion comes from. Unfortunately this approach wasn't quite right for this competition and my FameLab journey ended here. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and certainly 
			learnt a lot from it. If anyone is considering taking part, I highly recommend it. Who know's I might even give it another go myself.</p>
