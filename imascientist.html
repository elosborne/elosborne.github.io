					It’s an X Factor-style competition between scientists, where the students are the judges. </p>

					<p align="justify">I participated in the March 2016 event in the 'Gravity Zone'. There were many different zones ranging from 'Climate Change' to 'Toxicology'.
					 Each zone had 5 scientists, all experts and active researchers in fields relating to their zone theme. Students could ask us questions through 
					 the 'Ask' page and via 'Live Chats'. The live chats were my favourite. It involved 30 very intense minutes of frantic typing,
					 trying to answer questions from a class of students. It really challenged my ability to convey scientific ideas and my typing skills! 
					 The questions the students asked were very creative. It give me a huge insight into how students think and what they are thinking about. It was 
					 great to see how interested they are in science. I loved every minute of it!</p>
					 
					 <p align="justify"> After two fierce weeks of questions and competition, the results were in...The students had voted for me as their favourite scientist. This 
					 was such an incredible honour! I received £500 prize money to use for my own outreach project.I have decided to use the money to create youtube videos. In these videos I will explain key concepts from Einstein's theory of general relativity along with other 
					 interesting physics facts, in a way that everyone can understand. So far I have bought recording equipment, set up a youtube channel and written the first script.
					 Please watch this space!</p>
